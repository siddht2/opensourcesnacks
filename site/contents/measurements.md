Measurements

The measurements used here are relative volume-based. This means that if it says 1 cup, it doesn't matter if you use one big mug or one small doll's teacup, as long as you use the same everywhere.

It's a bit tricky to convert these recipes to metric as '1 cup of sunflower seeds' doesn't weigh the same as '1 cup of sesame seeds'. Odd but true.

This section will contain more information about converting to grams later.
